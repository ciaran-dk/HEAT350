Hi, 

here is finally our model output :)

I have started all runs with our long-term reconstruction for 1850 - 2006. This part is forced with observed loads and climate. Starting from 2007, the model is forced with a statistical representation of present climate and with loads according to 
- PLC55 (constant loads as in PLC5.5 2007 - 2200)
- BSAP (constant loads according to the new BSAP 2007-2200)
- BSAP30years (30 year linear transition period where loads decrease from PLC55 to BSAP, afterwards constant BSAP loads)
- BAU30years (load increase as in the Eccosupport BAU scenario with a 30 year transition period)

Take a look and let me know if there are problems with the output files (and, of course, if you want to have other scenarios run, let us know) - otherwise, looking forward to your HEAT results ;)

With respect to benthos, Karen Timmerman has actually used her model to reconstruct some of the benthos biomass in the Bornholm and Gotland basins for 1920 - 2006 based on the BALTSEM long-term hindcast. If you are seriously thinking about benthos, then we should talk to Karen.

Cheers,

Bärbel
